## HOW TO USE IT

Thanks to this extension, you can easily open related videos on Bing Videos in a new tab or window. Normally, the video playback pages on Bing Videos don’t let you open related videos in a new tab or window. With this extension, you can do this by right-clicking on the title of a video in the “Related videos” section below the main video being played. A nice little menu will appear, giving you two options: “Open in a new Tab” and “Open in a New Window”. Simply click on one of these options to open the related video in a new tab or window.
